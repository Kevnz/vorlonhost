You will find here all kind of plugins done by the community.

## Wappalyzer
This plugin uses Wappalyzer to detect "well-known" technologies used in a website implementation. 
It is based on script tags (to guess js libs for example), meta tags (to guess CMS), HTTP headers (to guess server type), etc. 

It could be useful for a dashboard connected to several distinct applications, or if some libraries are loaded accordingly to the device the user is running.
